# Airline Cancellations Api
This project was created as part of an interview process I participated in around the April 2021 time frame. 
The task is described in the file [api_task.pdf](api_task.pdf). Please consult it for how to operate this Api.

I have added a Postman collection file to test it at [Postman Collection File](AirlineCancellationApi.postman_collection.json). 
It assumes that you run the project with the Kestrel web server and not IIS Express. Consult the launchSettings.json file for the IIS Express port numbers.

Project was constructed using the free [Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) 

It is a .Net Core v3.1.10 WebApi Project.
